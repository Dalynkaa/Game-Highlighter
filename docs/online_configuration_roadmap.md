## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Integration Challenges**: Existing client code may require significant refactoring
  - *Mitigation*: Start with a thorough code review and create a detailed integration plan
  
- **Performance Issues**: Online features may impact client performance
  - *Mitigation*: Implement asynchronous operations and optimize network requests

- **Security Vulnerabilities**: Online systems introduce security concerns
  - *Mitigation*: Conduct regular security audits and follow best practices

### Project Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Features may expand beyond initial requirements
  - *Mitigation*: Maintain strict adherence to the phased approach and prioritize features

- **Timeline Delays**: Integration challenges may cause delays
  - *Mitigation*: Build buffer time into the schedule and be prepared to adjust scope

- **User Adoption**: Users may be reluctant to use online features
  - *Mitigation*: Create an intuitive UI and provide clear benefits for online features
