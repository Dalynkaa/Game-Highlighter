# Online Configuration System - Summary

## Overview
This document provides a summary of the proposed online configuration system for the Highlighter mod, which will allow users to publish, browse, and edit configurations online.

## Documentation Index
1. [Feature Map](online_configuration_feature_map.md) - Comprehensive overview of all features
2. [Technical Design](online_configuration_technical_design.md) - Detailed technical implementation plan
3. [UI Mockups](online_configuration_ui_mockups.md) - Visual representation of the user interface
4. [Implementation Roadmap](online_configuration_roadmap.md) - Timeline and milestones

## Key Features

### Publishing Configurations
- Users can publish their local configurations to the server
- Configurations can be made public or private
- Metadata includes name, description, and author information

### Browsing & Importing
- Users can browse public configurations
- Search and filter functionality
- Preview configurations before importing
- Multiple import options (full import, merge, selective)

### Online Editing
- Edit configurations directly on the server
- Version history and rollback functionality
- Collaborative editing with permissions system

### User Management
- User registration and authentication
- User profiles with configuration portfolios
- Usage statistics and analytics

## Integration with Existing System
The online configuration system will integrate with the existing Highlighter mod by:

1. Extending the current UI with an "Online" tab
2. Enhancing the PrefixStorage class to track online status
3. Building on the existing configuration model (PrefixConfiguration)
4. Leveraging the current serialization/deserialization functionality

## Implementation Approach
The implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Phase 1**: Basic publishing and importing functionality
2. **Phase 2**: Online editing and user profiles
3. **Phase 3**: Advanced features like collaboration and analytics

This approach allows for incremental delivery of value while managing complexity.

## Technical Architecture
The system uses a client-server architecture:

- **Client**: The Highlighter mod with added API client and UI components
- **Server**: RESTful API service with database for storing configurations and user data
- **Communication**: JSON over HTTPS with token-based authentication

## Next Steps
To begin implementation:

1. Set up the server infrastructure
2. Create the API client classes
3. Implement the basic UI components
4. Develop the authentication system
5. Begin testing with a small group of users

## Conclusion
The online configuration system will significantly enhance the Highlighter mod by allowing users to share and collaborate on configurations. This will create a community around the mod and provide users with access to a wide range of pre-made configurations.
